## üöÄ **Project Overview**

**LunaXplore** is an innovative project aimed at enhancing low-light images from the **Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR)** of lunar craters, captured by the **Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC)** onboard Chandrayaan-2. The PSR areas, located near the lunar poles, are perpetually shadowed, making it challenging to obtain high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) images suitable for exploration and scientific analysis.

## üåü **Proposed Solution**

**LunaXplore** combines advanced **Deep Learning** and **Image Processing** techniques to enhance PSR images. Using a custom workflow that includes **Contrast Enhancement**, **Denoising Algorithms**, and **Low-Light Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, this project produces high-resolution PSR image maps of the lunar poles, crucial for:
- üõ¨ **Landing Site Selection**: Identifying scientifically valuable and safe sites for future lunar missions.
- üèû **Geomorphological Studies**: Enabling detailed analysis of lunar surface features to support geological research.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python (for deep learning and image processing), MATLAB (optional, for certain image processing tasks)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: TensorFlow and Keras for GANs, OpenCV for image preprocessing, Retinex Theory-based custom algorithms for color balancing
- **Hardware Requirements**: High-performance computing (HPC) resources with GPU support are recommended for efficient model training and processing of large datasets

### **Methodology**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - **Data Sources**: Primary data from OHRC images, with auxiliary data from DFSAR (terrain), IIRS (infrared spectra), CLASS (elemental abundances), and SPICE (geometric and timing data) to add spatial, spectral, and contextual information.
   - **Preprocessing**: Normalize, reduce noise, and align coordinates using SPICE data for accurate mapping of PSR regions. 

2. **Image Enhancement Pipeline**:
   - **Low-Light Image Denoising**: Use Non-Local Means and deep-learning-based DnCNN models to reduce noise while retaining essential features.
   - **Contrast Enhancement**: Apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance visibility in shadowed areas.
   - **Low-Light GAN Model**: A custom GAN is developed to enhance image quality by generating high-resolution, detail-enhanced images from low-light inputs.

3. **Retinex Theory Application**:
   - **Theory Integration**: Utilize Retinex-based processing to simulate human vision by balancing light and color, enhancing details in low-light regions.

4. **Auxiliary Data Integration**:
   - **DFSAR Overlay**: Integrate radar-based terrain details to enhance structural feature visibility within PSR regions.
   - **IIRS and CLASS Overlays**: Use spectral and elemental data overlays to highlight geological compositions for comprehensive analysis.

5. **Spherical Visualization of the Lunar Surface**:
   - **Map Creation**: Organize enhanced PSR images into a polar map format, providing a comprehensive lunar visualization with PSR areas highlighted.

6. **Output**: The final product is a detailed, high-resolution PSR image map, accessible via a user-friendly interface for mission planning, scientific research, and exploration.

## üí° **Unique Features**

- **High-Resolution Lunar PSR Mapping**: Provides detailed, high-quality visualizations of PSR regions for scientific and mission-planning use.
- **Multi-Spectral and SAR Data Fusion**: Allows optional integration with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and infrared data for enhanced analysis of structural and compositional details.

## üß† **Feasibility and Viability**

### **Challenges**
- **Complexity of Low-Light Data**: Processing low-light lunar images with limited PSR data samples requires specialized training and enhancement techniques.
- **High Computational Requirements**: Large datasets and GAN model processing require significant computational resources.

### **Strategies**
- **Model Optimization and Regularization**: Use GAN regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and optimize training.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Leverage GPU support and HPC resources to streamline data processing and model training.

## üåç **Impact and Benefits**

**LunaXplore** aims to:
- **Advance Lunar Science**: Contribute valuable high-resolution data for lunar geological studies.
- **Support Future Missions**: Aid in the identification of optimal landing sites by producing clear images of previously obscured PSR regions.
- **Promote Technological Innovation in Space Imaging**: Pioneer advancements in AI and image processing tailored to space exploration.

## üìÅ **Repository Structure**

- `/data`: Contains example datasets (low-light OHRC images) and auxiliary data from DFSAR, IIRS, and CLASS for demonstration purposes.
- `/models`: Stores pre-trained GAN models and configuration files for model inference.
- `/src`: Source code for preprocessing, enhancement algorithms, GAN training, and integration with auxiliary data.
- `/docs`: Documentation files, including setup instructions and references.
- `/examples`: Sample outputs and visualization files for demonstration.

*Note*: Certain datasets may require separate access permissions (e.g., DFSAR or IIRS data), available via ISSDC or relevant databases.

## üîç **Sample Results**

To provide users with a reference, sample PSR enhancement outputs are included in the `/examples` folder. These examples demonstrate the expected quality of the enhanced images after processing with the LunaXplore pipeline.
