# LunaVision-PSR-ImageLab
Developed for SIH 2024 Problem ID 1732, this project focuses on enhancing low light images from PSR regions of lunar craters. The goal is to improve SNR for better interpretations, crucial for creating the first PSR image map of lunar poles captured by Chandrayaan-2's OHRC, aiding landing site selection and geomorphological studies.
