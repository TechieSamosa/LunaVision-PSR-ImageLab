## üöÄ **Project Overview**

**LunaVision-PSR-ImageLab** is a pioneering project developed to enhance low-light images captured from the **Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR)** of lunar craters by the **Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC)** onboard Chandrayaan-2. These lunar poles' regions are in constant shadow, receiving only minimal reflected light, making it challenging to obtain high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) images suitable for scientific analysis and exploration.

## üåü **Proposed Solution**

Our solution employs state-of-the-art **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** in combination with **Retinex Theory** to significantly improve the visibility and clarity of PSR images under extreme low-light conditions. By harnessing the generative capabilities of GANs and Retinex Theory‚Äôs approach to simulate human vision through light and color balance, **LunaVision-PSR-ImageLab** strives to produce a high-resolution PSR image map of the lunar poles, which is crucial for:
- üõ¨ **Landing Site Selection:** Identifying scientifically valuable and safe sites for future lunar missions.
- üèû **Geomorphological Studies:** Supporting lunar surface feature analysis to enhance understanding of lunar geology.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages:** Python (for GAN and image processing), MATLAB
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow for GANs, OpenCV for image preprocessing, Retinex Theory-based custom algorithms
- **Hardware Requirements:** High-performance computing resources for efficient model training and large dataset processing

### **Methodology**

1. **Image Acquisition:** Obtain raw images of PSR regions captured by Chandrayaan-2's OHRC.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize and reduce noise from images to prepare high-quality input for the model.

3. **Image Enhancement with GANs:**
   - **GAN Setup:** A Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) structure is tailored for enhancing lunar PSR imagery.
   - **Training Process:** Train the GAN using a curated set of 208 low-light images, iteratively refining the network to generate high-resolution, detail-enhanced images from low-light data.

4. **Retinex Theory Application:** Integrate Retinex Theory to further enhance perceptual quality, optimizing the balance of light and color for clearer image output.

5. **Post-Processing:** Utilize contrast adjustment, edge sharpening, and additional noise reduction techniques to produce final high-resolution images.

6. **Spherical Visualization of the Lunar Surface:** Organize enhanced images in a spherical format for a comprehensive "moon-view" visualization, highlighting PSR areas on the lunar poles.

7. **Output:** The final output is a detailed, high-resolution PSR image map intended for advanced scientific analysis and exploration.

## üí° **Unique Features**

- **High-Resolution Lunar PSR Mapping:** Generates a clear image map of PSR regions to facilitate mission planning, scientific analysis, and geological studies.
- **Fusion with SAR Data (Optional):** Enables integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to amplify structural details in PSR regions.

## üß† **Feasibility and Viability**

### **Challenges**
- **Training GANs on Limited PSR Data:** The unique nature of lunar PSR images requires specialized training techniques.
- **Balancing Computational Load:** Processing large datasets and running complex GAN models demand significant computational resources.

### **Strategies**
- **GAN Regularization and Optimization:** Employ techniques like regularization to prevent overfitting, while optimizing GAN parameters for efficient training.
- **High-Performance Computing:** Leverage HPC resources to streamline data processing and model training.

## üåç **Impact and Benefits**
