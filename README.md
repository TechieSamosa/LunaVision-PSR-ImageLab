## 🚀 **Project Overview**

**LunaVision-PSR-ImageLab** is an innovative project developed for **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024** under Problem Statement ID SIH1732. The project aims to tackle the challenge of enhancing low-light images captured from the **Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR)** of lunar craters by the **Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC)** onboard Chandrayaan-2. These regions, found at the lunar poles, are perpetually in shadow, reflecting only feeble light, making it extremely challenging to produce high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) images that are crucial for scientific analysis and exploration.

## 🌟 **Proposed Solution**

Our solution integrates cutting-edge **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Retinex Theory** to significantly improve the visibility and clarity of images captured under these extreme low-light conditions. By leveraging the strengths of GANs in generating high-quality images and Retinex Theory's ability to simulate human vision and balance light and color, **LunaVision-PSR-ImageLab** aims to produce the first-ever PSR image map of the lunar poles. This map will be instrumental for:
- 🛬 **Landing Site Selection:** Identifying safe and scientifically valuable sites for future lunar missions.
- 🏞 **Geomorphological Studies:** Aiding in the analysis of lunar surface features to deepen our understanding of lunar geology.

## 🛠️ **Technical Approach**

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages:** Python, MATLAB
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow for GANs, OpenCV for image processing, custom algorithms based on Retinex Theory
- **Hardware:** High-performance computing resources for training GANs and processing large datasets

### **Methodology**
1. **Image Acquisition:** Collect raw images from Chandrayaan-2's OHRC, focusing on PSR regions.
2. **Preprocessing:** Apply initial noise reduction and normalization to prepare the data.
3. **Image Enhancement with GANs:** Develop and train a GAN model to generate high-quality images from low-light data.
4. **Application of Retinex Theory:** Enhance the perceptual quality, balancing light and color.
5. **Post-Processing:** Fine-tune the images with contrast adjustment, edge sharpening, and noise reduction.
6. **Output:** Generate a high-resolution PSR image map for further analysis.

## 🧠 **Feasibility and Viability**

### **Challenges**
- Training GANs specifically for lunar PSR data.
- Integrating Retinex Theory into the enhancement pipeline.
- Handling the computational intensity of large datasets and complex models.

### **Strategies**
